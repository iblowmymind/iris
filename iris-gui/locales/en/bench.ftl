# Benchmark tab.

## Controls

bench-heading = Benchmark
bench-subtitle =
bench-run-mac = Benchmark this Mac
bench-run-pc = Benchmark this PC
# $secs is a rough run time in seconds.
bench-run-tip = Takes about { $secs } seconds.
bench-cpu-tip = Scores from different CPUs aren't comparable.
bench-quick = Quick run
bench-quick-tip = Runs each kernel once with shorter timing. Accuracy is unaffected; speed figures are a little noisier.
bench-stop = Stop
bench-machine-running = Stop the machine to run a benchmark.

## Progress

bench-starting = Starting…
# $kernel is the name of the test running now, such as int/alu.
bench-progress = { $kernel } ({ $done } of { $total })
# Times in seconds.
bench-time-total = { $elapsed } s elapsed, about { $total } s in total
bench-time-left = { $elapsed } s elapsed, about { $left } s left
bench-stopped = Stopped.
# $error is the reason, in English.
bench-failed = The benchmark didn't finish: { $error }

## Results

bench-results = Results
bench-dmips = Emulated Indy
bench-dmips-value = { $value } DMIPS
bench-dmips-tip = Dhrystone 2.1 score. A real 150 MHz Indy scores about 130.
bench-mips = Emulator speed
bench-mips-value = { $value } MIPS
bench-mips-tip = Guest instructions run per second.
bench-accuracy = Accuracy
bench-accuracy-value = { $percent }% ({ $matched } of { $checked })
bench-accuracy-tip = Tests whose result matched a natively computed checksum. Anything below 100% is an emulator bug.
# $ratio is a number such as 1.25; $reference names the reference machine.
bench-ratio = { $ratio }× vs { $reference }
bench-no-reference = No reference results for this platform yet.
# $reason is in English, such as "30% timing, 1 repeat".
bench-caveat-quick = Quick run ({ $reason }). Accuracy is unaffected.
bench-caveat-interpreter = This build has no MIPS JIT. JIT builds score about four times higher, so these numbers aren't comparable with theirs.
# $kernels is a comma-separated list of test names.
bench-caveat-exceptions = Unexpected exceptions in { $kernels }. Those figures aren't reliable.
bench-save-report = Save report…
bench-save-report-picker = Save benchmark report
bench-save-report-filter = JSON

bench-machine-memory = Memory
# $banks is a list of bench-machine-bank entries.

bench-machine-emulator = Emulator
bench-machine-no-features = No optional features

## Developer tools

bench-dev = Developer tools
bench-dev-subtitle =
bench-dev-matrix = Full matrix
bench-dev-matrix-tip = Builds and runs R4400 and R5000, with and without the JIT. Takes tens of minutes and needs cargo.
bench-dev-host = Measure this host
bench-dev-host-tip = Runs the same tests compiled natively, for comparison.
bench-dev-not-built = iris-bench isn't built. Run cargo build --release --bin iris-bench.
bench-dev-open-results = Open results folder
# $path is the iris-bench program, $error the system's error text.
bench-dev-start-failed = Couldn't start { $path }: { $error }
bench-dev-matrix-finished = Matrix finished.
bench-dev-matrix-failed = Matrix failed.
bench-dev-host-finished = Host measurement finished.
bench-dev-host-failed = Host measurement failed.
